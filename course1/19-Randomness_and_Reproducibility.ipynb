    "# Probability distributions, randomness, and sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a description of a means for generating random values. The probability distribution specifies what values can be observed (the _sample space_), and how likely it is that each specific value is observed (the _probabilities_). A simple example is a toss of a fair coin, where the sample space is {head, tail} and the corresponding probabilities are 1/2, 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many \"named\" probability distributions such as the Normal, exponential, and Poisson distributions. We will illustrate a few of these distributions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, probability distributions are used to define the unknown _population_ of interest, from which we observe a _sample_ of data from which we learn about the population. This process of \"sampling\" is one of the fundamental issues that is considered by most statistical procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many statistical procedures are based on idealized infinite populations (sometimes called _superpopulations_). For example, if we repeatedly measure the moisture content of a soil sample, we will obtain a slightly different value each time due to various inconsistencies in the measurement process. We might decide to treat these values as following a normal distribution, centered at the true (unknown) soil moisture concentration, with a dispersion (standard deviation) that reflects the precision of the measurement process. Since a sample of one observation from a normal distribution can produce any real number, this is an infinite population.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with infinite populations, it is oftent useful to talk about an _independent and identically distributed_ sample, or an _IID_ sample. This is a collection of random values that follow the given distribution, which are independent of each other (we will discuss independence later in the course, but roughly speaking it means that no observation in the sample contains information that can be used to predict the value of another observation in the sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some statistical procedures take a _finite population_ perspective, in which the population of interest is seen as a finite collection of unknown values, and we observe a _simple random sample_ from this finite population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will consider sampling from both idealized infinite populations and finite populations.\n"

    "### Generating random values from a distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we usually observe our data by making observations in the natural world, and then we analyze the data by fitting probability models to it. Sometimes it is useful to generate a sample of data from a given distribution on a computer. Since computers are inherently deterministic devices, it is not obvious how to do this. We won't go into the details on this point here, but it turns out to be possible to construct _pseudo-random_ sequences that behave like samples from a given distribution, although the values themselves are actually deterministic.\n",
