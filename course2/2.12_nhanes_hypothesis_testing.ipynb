This test is used if we have specified a particular value as the null value for the proportion, and we wish to assess if the data are compatible with the true parameter value being equal to this specified value.

This distinction is rarely consequential, but we can specify that the null proportion should be used to calculate the standard error, and the results agree exactly with what we calculated above. The first two lines below carry out tests using the normal approximation to the sampling distribution of the test statistic, and the third line below carries uses the exact binomial sampling distribution. We can see here that the p-values are nearly identical in all three cases. This is expected when the sample size is large, and the proportion is not close to either 0 or 1.\n"

A two-sample test of proportions is used to assess whether the proportion of individuals with some trait differs between two sub-populations.

In the cell below, we carry out this test without using any libraries, implementing all the test procedures covered elsewhere in the course using Python code.

For example, in NHANES, systolic blood pressure is measured at least two times (sometimes there is a third measurement) on each subject. Although the measurements are repeated, there is no guarantee that the mean is the same each time, i.e. the mean blood pressure may be slightly lower on the second measurement compared to the first, since people are a bit more nervous the first time they are measured. A paired test is a modified form of mean test that can be used when we are comparing two repeated measurements on the same unit.\n",

Below we see that in the entire NHANES sample, the first measurement of systolic blood pressure is on average 0.67 mm/Hg greater than the second measurement. While this difference is not large, it is strongly statistically significant. That is, there is strong evidence that the mean values for the first and second blood pressure measurement differ.\n"

Here we will study the relationship between the sample size (amount of data), and the behavior of a hypothesis test. For illustration, we will use the paired t-test for assessing whether the first and second systolic blood pressure measurement have different means, restricting to people between 50 and 60 years of age.\n",

This process is repeated 500 times for each sample size. We report the fraction of these 500 trials where the p-value was smaller than 0.05. A higher fraction of trials where p<0.05 implies that it is easier to detect a difference between the first and second blood pressure measurements. We see that this proportion (called \"statistical power\") is only around 0.2 when the sample size is 100, and grows to essentially 100% when the sample size is 800. Note that all of these subsamples are drawn from the same parent population, so there is no change from subsample to subsample in terms of whether the means are truly different. The only thing that changes is our evidence that the difference is real. When the sample size is small, we rarely amass such evidence.\n"
